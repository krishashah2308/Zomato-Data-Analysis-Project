## Overview  

The Zomato dataset contains valuable information about restaurants, including their ratings, online ordering availability, booking options, and approximate cost for two people. This project aims to analyze this data to reveal patterns such as:  

- Distribution of restaurant ratings  
- Relationship between online ordering and table booking  
- Impact of votes on ratings  
- Cost analysis of restaurants based on type
